Due to privacy regulations I cannot provide the HIV indicators. I can only share the three lists with permission of EMC. Since this GitHub repository is openly available I cannot ask for permission for everyone. 
Either, the synthetic database (translated n2c2 notes) I created is not available because of privacy regulations. Access to the English dataset n2c2 is only given with permission of DBMI. 
A detailed description about the HIV indicators and data can be found in my thesis in Section 3.2 and 4.2.2.
